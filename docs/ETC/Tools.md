`CapAnalysis is a web visual tool for information security specialists, system administrators and everyone who needs to analyze large amounts of captured network traffic.
CapAnalysis performs indexing of data set of PCAP files and presents their contents in many forms, starting from a list of TCP, UDP or ESP streams/flows, passing to the geo-graphical representation of the connections.`

* <https://github.com/netzob/netzob>  
`tool for reverse engineering, traffic generation and fuzzing of communication protocols. This tool allows to infer the message format (vocabulary) and the state machine (grammar) of a protocol through passive and active processes. Its objective is to bring state of art academic researches to the operational field, by leveraging bio-informatic and grammatical inferring algorithms in a semi-automatic manner. Netzob is suitable for reversing network protocols, structured files and system and process flows (IPC and communication with drivers and devices). Once inferred, a protocol model can be used in our traffic generation engine, to allow simulation of realistic and controllable communication endpoints and flows. Netzob handles different types of protocols: text protocols (like HTTP and IRC), delimiter-based protocols, fixed fields protocols (like IP and TCP) and variable-length fields protocols (like TLV-based protocols).`
