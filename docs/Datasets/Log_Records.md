`The Mordor project provides pre-recorded security events generated by simulated adversarial techniques in the form of JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) files for easy consumption. The pre-recorded data is categorized by platforms, adversary groups, tactics and techniques defined by the Mitre ATT&CK Framework. The pre-recorded data represents not only specific known malicious events but additional context/events that occur around it. This is done on purpose so that you can test creative correlations across diverse data sources, enhancing your detection strategy and potentially reducing the number of false positives in your own environment.`

Reference from the repo: "Big sandbox vendors do not provide the information that a blue teamer would like to see in the reports. For me it was always important to see Windows Eventlog events in these reports - especially to create Sigma rules. The sandboxes that I use do not provide this feature. So I decided to add that feature to the samples that I drop in form of a wrapper.
Exotron wraps the sample in a set of commands that run before and after the sample exeuction."

`log examples of Zeek that are used for testing. Can be used as a good baseline for how some of the logs look. It is a bit "difficult" to navigate, but if you click into the folders you will find logs.
